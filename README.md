Welcome to the AI Labs repository, a collection of hands-on labs and projects designed to help ENSEA 2A students explore AI concepts and practical deployment. Covering Natural Language Processing (NLP), Computer Vision, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), Recommendation Systems, and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), this repository provides a first experience in AI deployment.

You'll train Neural Style Transfer models, build LLMs, develop recommender systems, and implement graph-based AI models—all while learning how to deploy them in real-world applications. Whether you're working on model inference, API integrations, or simple web-based AI demos, these labs offer a solid foundation for stepping into AI engineering.

Let me know if you'd like any refinements! 🚀

## 🚀 How to Use  

1. **Open in Google Colab** – Replace `github.com` with `githubtocolab.com` in the URL to launch notebooks.  
2. **Enable GPU** – Accelerate training by enabling GPU (`Runtime` > `Change runtime type` > `Hardware accelerator` > `GPU`).  
3. **Save Your Work** – Copy notebooks to your Google Drive for future reference.  
4. **Complete Preparations** – Ensure all pre-lab exercises are done before attending lab sessions.
