    "In this notebook, we are going to build state-of-the art models for text classification using the example of sentiment analysis. To be more precise, we will build a feed-forward neural network (FFNN) and a convolutional neural network (CNN). We will look into the details of data preparation, functioning of each model and how the performance of those NNs could be measured efficiently. We will start our work using a toy corpus. Further you can extend your knowledge and use a larger dataset. Again we are using [pytorch](https://www.pytorch.org), an open source deep learning platform, as our backbone library in the course.\n",
