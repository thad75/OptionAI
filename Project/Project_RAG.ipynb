    "\n",
    "This project is voluntarly sparsely helped, as, as engineers, you will dig into lots of existing method, and will need to pick the best one up. We want you to get familiar with the engineering world.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will give you some recommendations. You will see lots of issues during this project, some you've already seen during Labs, other that are new. So buckle up, read the docs, and RAG your data.\n",

    "Obviously there are lots of tutorials of the internet that you could just copy paste to get a baseline.\n",
